    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="text"> Never underestimate the power of great chicken sandwiches! Excellent platter for gatherings, picnics and work lunches. My secrets? Fresh dill, a handful of walnuts and shred the chicken really finely using a stand-mixer or electric beater. Yes, really.</p>

    <h2>How to make deli-style chicken sandwiches</h2>

    <ol class="text">
        <li>Remove flesh off the chicken and remove the skin.</li>
        <li>Shred the chicken as finely as you can. It takes about 1 minute on medium speed using a stand-mixer using the paddle attachment (not whisk, it gets all caught up in the wires). A hand-held beater will also work but will take a bit longer. Else, use your hands.</li>
        <li>Mix sauce ingredients in a bowl until smooth. Use a whisk, if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over the chicken with remaining Filling ingredients (walnuts, celery, green onion, pickle, dill) and mix until combined.
            At this stage, you should sneak in a taste test and marvel at how soft and creamy the chicken sandwich filling is!</li>

    <figcaption style="max-width:600px; font-size:16px">When you shred the chicken finely, it makes the chicken filling really soft and creamy – just like the chicken sandwiches you get from gourmet delis!</figcaption>
    <ol class ="text" start="5">
        <li>Butter the bread. This not only provides extra flavour but a protection barrier so the sauce of the chicken filling doesn’t soak into the bread.</li>
        <li>Spread the filling on the bread, from edge to edge.</li>
        <li>Cut off crusts – I typically don’t cut the crust off sandwiches but for chicken sandwiches, I do if I’m making them for other people. Partly so they look neat – think High-Tea finger sandwich style – and also because then you get the full effect of the soft creamy chicken filling with just soft white bread. No tough crust getting in the way of the eating experience!

            PS You know full well the crusts get eaten right? Plenty of chicken filling makes its way to the crust!</li>
        <li>Cut in half on the diagonal, or into rectangles, then line them upon a platter!

            TIP: If you want really neat edges, refrigerate the assembled sandwiches for at least 2 hours before slicing. This will make the filling firm up and makes it easier to cut neatly. I did not do this for the sandwiches pictured in this post. You know that patience is not my greatest virtue!</li>
